kubernetes : Containerasation Management ,vertical & horizontal scaling , command line & GUI interface,
Architecture 
How to Deploy : 2 vm's---1 master and 1 slave
master should have atleast 2 core cpu's & 4GB RAM
Nodes  should have atleast 1 core CPU & 4GB RAM ,ubuntu O.S
On Master 
ifconfig--- finding IP address of the master machine
sudo kubeadm init--pod-network-cidr=<> --apiserver-advertise-address=<ip-address-of-master>
//For starting a Calico CNI : 192.168.0.0/16 or For starting a plannel CNI : 10.244.0.0/16
// copy the kubeadm token generated on the terminal -----helpful for joining the nodes or connecting slave to the master

U will find the 3 commands on the terminal like to start using your cluster,you need to run the following as aregular user---copy that commands  and paste it in the same page of the master

// For creating a POD based on Calico
//want to know the nodes
kubectl get nodes
//Want to know the PODS
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces -o wide
//For Creating the dashboard first - bring this up before starting or joining the Nodes
// To enable Proxy and continues with new terminal window
kubectl proxy
copy the ip address and paste it website like localhost:8001
//For dashboard create the service account
kubectl create serviceaccount dashboard -n default
//Role Binding
kubectl create clusterrolebinding dashboard-admin -n default \
 --clusterrole=cluster-admin \
 --serviceaccount=default:dashboard
 //To get the secret key to be pasted into the dashboard token pwd,copy the outcoming secrete key
 we will get the token generated in master terminal and paste in the localhost:8001------- and then login is accessible to kubernetes dashboards
 open node terminal---master IP paste in the node terminal
 IN Dashboard---we can see master and nodes
 //How to deploy the apps  by using the GUI in dashboard---Create an app---app name--nginx(container image)--no of pods(Containers)--1/2 ---External--port no : 82 , 80--DEPLOY---click on 1 pod--copy the port number and paste in the localhost we will see the page
//HOw to deploy the apps through CLI on master terminal  
//1st create a deployment----> kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx
//Verify the deployment --->kubectl get deployments
//more details about the deployment---->kubectl describe deployment nginx
//Create service on the nodes-----> kubectl create service nodeport nginx --tcp=80:80
//To check which deployment is running on which node----> kubectl get svc
//To delete deployment ------> kubectl delete deployment <name>
//Deployment via yaml code 
//write the yaml code in nodepad and save as file in your system
ls
gedit deployment.yaml----file name
//Create a Deployment using Yaml ---> kubectl create -f deployment.yaml
